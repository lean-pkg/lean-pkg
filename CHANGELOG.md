## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-05

First tagged release: the tool extracted from its private lab origin into its own
repository, with the comparator tier and the documentation site. The
repository is private at this version; checks were run locally (see
RELEASING.md).

### Added
- `lean-pkg` registry CLI: statuses `scratch → active → gate-pending →
  verified-private → public → upstreamed`, leases (`claim`/`release`),
  lower-tier receipts (`lake build`, sorry scan, `#print axioms`) bound to a
  commit, `gate`, `promote` with a dry-run checklist and a one-way `--yes`,
  `audit`, `llms` contract output.
- Comparator tier: `comparator-receipt` runner wrapping the vendored Palomar
  `comparator-check.sh`; all-or-nothing evidence write; host policy;
  `lean-pkg comparator --receipt [--check]`; `gate --comparator`;
  audit findings `comparator-drift` and `comparator-missing`.
- Evidence-only descendant rule: a receipt bound to commit X is accepted at
  HEAD H when H descends from X and only `.lean-receipts/` paths differ.
- Eighteen agent skills under `skills/` with an installer for Claude Code
  and Codex (`scripts/install_skills.py`).
- Documentation site (`docs/`, Jekyll Cayman): motivation, getting started,
  how-to, lifecycle, receipts, comparator, CLI, agents, newcomers, sample
  workflow with a seven-step diagram, FAQ, skills; client-side search and a
  dark/light toggle; `llms.txt`.
- Private-boundary check (`scripts/private-boundary-check.sh`) and a test
  suite of 240 tests.
- Secretary-bird logo and favicon; `CITATION.cff`.
