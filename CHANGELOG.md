## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `lean-pkg formalization NAME [--write] [--out PATH] [--force] [--author NAME]`:
  render the package's `formalization.yaml` (mathlib-initiative schema v0.4,
  the file Palomar reads) from the registry and the repository at HEAD.
  Derived keys are regenerated every run (`project.name`, `project.license`,
  `automation.notes`, `status.sorry_count`/`axioms`/`evidence` from the gate
  receipt, `status.main_results` from every tracked comparator configuration
  with `judged_as` carried for definition holes, `alignment` from
  `claims.yaml`); every other key is kept from the existing file, seeded on
  first render from registry data (authors from `consent[]` owners/authors,
  Mathlib `builds-on`) or with a marked `[PLACEHOLDER]` and a stderr warning.
  Nothing is invented: the registry holds no paper metadata, so `sources` is
  a placeholder until a human fills it. `--write` is idempotent, refuses a
  differing file without `--force`, and sets `formalization_yaml` through the
  `update` path. Validated against the vendored v0.4 JSON schema
  (`src/lean_pkg/schemas/`, upstream commit `99c678e5`, fetched 2026-10-07)
  with `jsonschema` when importable, else a structural check (docs/formalization.md).
- `lean-pkg audit`: `formalization-missing` and `formalization-drift`
  findings for packages whose `formalization_yaml` is set (the file no longer
  equals what the generator emits); `audit` never rewrites it.

- Definition holes need a human sign-off: a comparator configuration with a
  non-empty `definition_names` is refused unless it carries
  `judged_as {reviewer, date, definitions ⊇ definition_names, basis?}` naming
  a human (model/agent tokens refused). Enforced by `comparator-check.sh`, by
  `comparator-receipt` before anything is built (nothing written), and by
  every validator against the file at the bound commit. The runner copies
  `judged_as` into the receipt entry when present (optional field; old
  receipts still validate). Rationale: comparator compares holes by name and
  type only, never by body (`src/lean_pkg/holes.py`, docs/comparator.md).
- `comparator-check.sh --configs <glob>` (repeatable discovery override) and
  `--lint-configs` (configuration rules only, jq-only, no build).
- `comparator-check.sh`: `LEAN4EXPORT_ALLOW_TOOLCHAIN_MISMATCH=1` with
  `LEAN4EXPORT_COMMIT` builds lean4export under the project toolchain in a
  dedicated checkout and verifies the binary's reported Lean version, for
  point releases lean4export never tagged (v4.34.1); the deviation is printed
  on its own `== lean4export toolchain override:` line.

- `scripts/private-boundary-check.sh --history` and `make history`: scan every
  blob and commit message reachable from any ref (the public-flip prerequisite).
- REUSE 3.3 compliance: `REUSE.toml`, `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`, `make reuse`
  (part of `make check`; skipped with a notice when the tool is absent).

- `lean-pkg gate` and `lean-pkg comparator` scan the receipt bytes for
  private local paths (the `index add` scan) before copying them into
  `.lean-receipts/`: each hit is a stderr `WARN` naming the field and the
  kind of string (never the value) and an entry of `"private_strings"` in the
  JSON payload. `--refuse-private` turns the warning into a refusal (exit 1,
  nothing copied). Mapping keys are scanned as well as values; a private key
  is labelled by position (`receipt.artifacts.<key#0>`), never by its text
  (also in the `index add` scan).

- `lean-pkg audit --toolchain-floor VERSION` (env `LEAN_PKG_TOOLCHAIN_FLOOR`,
  default `leanprover/lean4:v4.35.0-rc2`, Palomar's floor): a
  `below-toolchain-floor` finding for every package whose `lean_toolchain` is
  older, except `scratch` and `archived` ones. Versions compare as
  `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-rcN]` with an rc older than its release; nightly and
  other strings are reported as `toolchain-unparsed`, never compared.

- `lean-pkg --version` prints `lean-pkg <version>` and exits 0.
- `lean-pkg doctor [--json]`: one `ok`/`warn`/`n/a` line each for the
  version, the install (editable checkouts add short HEAD, branch, and
  behind/ahead counts against `origin/<branch>` from local refs only, never
  fetched), the registry and its schema version, the event log, the index and
  its entry count, `lake`/`elan`/`git`/`gh`/`reuse`/`bwrap`/`comparator`/`nanoda`
  on PATH, and the Python version. Exit 0 unless the registry is unreadable.

### Changed

- The vendored `scripts/comparator-check.sh` now carries the lab additions
  above and is no longer byte-for-byte the Palomar verifier script; tool pins
  are unchanged.

### Fixed

- `make test` runs pytest with a private bytecode cache
  (`PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` in a fresh `mktemp -d` directory, removed
  afterwards; `-p no:cacheprovider` kept), so concurrent runs no longer share
  pytest's rewritten `.pyc` files (a segmentation fault inside
  `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` was observed with two sessions at once). The
  gate is safe to run concurrently (RELEASING.md).

- `lean-pkg audit` no longer prints one `warn` line per package whose `repo`
  is not a GitHub URL (the line echoed the repo path, which may be private).
  Each such package gets a `no-github-mirror` finding with the fixed detail
  "repo is not on GitHub; visibility not mirrored"; the human output collapses
  them into one line "N package(s) without a GitHub mirror (visibility not
  checked): a, b, c", and `--json` keeps one finding per package. `gh query
  failed` warnings are unchanged. Check names longer than the column (such as
  `below-toolchain-floor`) are now separated from the package name by a space.

- `lean-pkg audit` judges `receipt-drift` and `comparator-drift` against the
  package's reference branch (the remote default branch from
  `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, else `main`, else `master`, else HEAD; local refs
  only; when the local branch and `origin/<b>` both exist, the tip that contains
  the other, and origin with a note when they diverged), not
  the checkout's HEAD, so a checkout parked on a feature branch no longer
  reports false drift. The evidence-only-descendant rule is unchanged. When
  the checkout is on another branch, a `checkout-branch` finding says
  "checkout on X; judged against B" and drift details carry the same note.

- Prior-art record slugs longer than 60 characters get an 8-hex suffix of the
  full slug, so two long terms sharing a prefix no longer share a record file.

- `index migrate [--check]`: rewrite `index-entry/1` entries as `index-entry/2`
  with `claims` derived from the headline; the two first entries migrated.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-06

### Added
- `update --license-spdx SPDX` and `update --formalization-yaml REL` set the
  registry row's publication facts (previously only `register` could).
- Index: third entry `total-coloring-lean` (lower-tier at 55edc814; the
  example of an unfinished project: two proved headlines, goal and gaps in
  notes).
- Docs: how an unfinished project is listed honestly (headlines are what is
  proved, goals and gaps in `notes`, partial results as `experimental` claims,
  progress as a new pin), with `total-coloring-lean` as the example; FAQ entry.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-06

Claim-level prior-art search (issue #4): search before building, across the
group's own packages and the public sources, with a citable record.

### Added
- `claims.yaml` (schema `claims/1`) at a package repository root: named,
  reusable results with stable ids `<package>/<slug>`, kinds, statuses,
  aliases, keywords, supersession (acyclic) and dependencies.
- `lean-pkg claims sync NAME` reads the file at `HEAD`, checks every
  declaration occurs in its file, and caches the claims with the commit in
  the registry (event `claims-synced`); `claims list` and `claims check`.
- `lean-pkg search TERM`: registry claims, the public index, Loogle,
  LeanSearch, Reservoir (the index data, cached by commit, never the
  name-only site search), Palomar (results API, cached by revision) and
  GitHub, in that fixed order; every source `ok` or `skipped: <reason>`,
  never zero hits when unreachable; `--offline`, `--sources`, `--json`.
- `lean-pkg search --record` writes `docs/prior-art/<date>-<slug>.md` in the
  research repository (`decision: pending` for a human) and one
  `prior-art-searched` event; claims of other private packages are listed
  only in a private package's record, marked `private-claims: yes`.
- Index: `index-entry/2` adds `claims[]`, derived from the headline at
  `index add`; `index check` refuses claims that drift from the headline;
  `index render` lists them. `index-entry/1` entries stay valid.
- Advisory notes: `claim` when a package has no recent search and no claims,
  `index add` when no record at the pin names a headline.
- Docs page `docs/prior-art.md`.

### Changed
- Registry version 3: `claims_file`, `claims`, `claims_synced_commit`
  (additive; `lean-pkg migrate` moves v1 and v2 files forward; both stay
  readable).

### Fixed (fresh-model review of the branch)
- A record never says "Not found in registry" when registry hits were
  withheld for privacy; the Hits cell says `0 shown (+N withheld)`.
- Search terms are folded (accents stripped, any script's letters count):
  `Itô` matches `Ito`; `ε` and `黎曼` are valid terms.
- `--repo-dir` outside the package's own checkout is treated as an unknown
  target, so other private packages' claims are withheld.
- Skip reasons are scrubbed of local paths before they reach output or a record.
- The record is created atomically and never follows a symlink; a malformed
  registry entry makes the registry source `skipped: unreadable` instead of a traceback.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-10-06

### Added
- Index: `markovprocess-pilot` now at comparator trust; its headline theorem
  is judged through a Mathlib-only Challenge (`exit_mean`) by `lake comparator`.

### Fixed
- `COMPARATOR_RECEIPT_HOST_LABEL` now also replaces the host name in the
  receipt's `host_policy` sentence (a copied receipt leaked it).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-10-06

### Changed
- Index: `comparator` trust requires coverage. Each headline item may carry
  `judged_as`, the Challenge theorem name; comparator trust needs every
  headline judged by a configuration in the receipt, else the entry is
  lower-tier (with a lower-tier receipt) or refused.
- The comparator PASS predicate is the full line `Your solution is okay!`
  for both mechanisms, as observed in the first live `lake comparator` run
  (2026-10-06); the kernel acceptance phrase alone no longer counts.
- The sample workflow page says which steps were run and which are
  illustrative; it shows the live toolchain run.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-06

The index schema (milestone M1's catalog layer, pulled forward): a public,
forkable list of trust-graded packages whose every row can be re-derived
from bytes at its pin.

### Added
- `index/<name>/entry.yaml`, schema `index-entry/1` (keys in a fixed order;
  unknown keys refused; no local paths), with verbatim receipt copies under
  `index/<name>/receipts/`. The index root is `--index PATH`, env
  `LEAN_PKG_INDEX`, or `./index`.
- `lean-pkg index add NAME`: builds an entry from the registry row
  (`--from-registry`) or from flags, reads the receipts from a clone at the
  pin, validates them with the `gate` and `comparator` validators, computes
  the trust level (`lower-tier`, `comparator`, `palomar`), refuses a
  duplicate repository and commit, and appends `index-added` to the event log.
- `lean-pkg index check [NAME ...] [--clone | --repo-dir PATH]`: static
  checks, or a re-derivation from bytes at the pin (receipts, logs,
  toolchain, `lake-manifest.json`, license, tag, headline files) with trust
  recomputed; Palomar ids and Reservoir listings are verified by API when
  reachable and reported as skipped otherwise. Exit 0, 1 or 2; `--json`.
- `lean-pkg index render [--out PATH] [--check]`: the Markdown table
  `index/README.md`, with a do-not-hand-edit banner; a test keeps it current.
- Docs: [The index](docs/index-catalog.md); CONTRIBUTING, the pull-request
  template and the index-entry issue template use the schema's field names.
- First index entry: `gromov-filling-lean` (lower-tier; Lean v4.29.0; pin
  1c4ccb9c; receipt produced on the Auburn University Easley Cluster).
- Safety of the index (from the fresh-model review): evidence files are
  written with symlinks refused at the pin and on disk; a rename into
  `.lean-receipts/` is no longer evidence-only (`gate` benefits too); a
  Palomar id grades an entry only at its registered commit and `check`
  compares the Palomar entry's source with the index entry; `index add`
  verifies that the pin and evidence are on a public branch unless
  `--allow-unpushed`; receipt copies with local-path strings are refused;
  `COMPARATOR_RECEIPT_HOST_LABEL` gives receipts a public-safe host; `render`
  fails cleanly on a malformed entry; one broken entry no longer blocks
  checking another; the private-boundary check is case-insensitive.

- `LEAN_PKG_EVENTS`: environment variable for the event-log path (after
  `--events`, before the registry's sibling file).

### Fixed
- `lean_pkg.__version__` now agrees with `pyproject.toml` (it still read 0.1.0).
- Documentation site: complete dark-mode palette (header, links, syntax
  colours, tables, footer, search, copy buttons) and light-mode contrast,
  measured to WCAG AA on every page; the workflow diagram is a light card in
  both themes.
- A comparator receipt produced under the test-only digest override now
  carries `test_only: true` and is refused by every validator.
- The toolchain probe requires the judging binaries to be executable, as the
  vendored script does.


## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-06

Milestone M0 of the charter: a tool the lab can consume instead of its own
copy. Checks were run locally with `make check` (hosted CI turns on at the
public flip).

### Added
- `lean-pkg init`: bootstrap an empty registry and its event log; refuses an
  existing registry unless `--force` and it holds no packages.
- Registry schema v2 and `lean-pkg migrate`: additive publication fields per
  package (`license_spdx`, `formalization_yaml`, `palomar[]`, `doi`,
  `reservoir`, `consent[]`); v1 registries stay readable by every command;
  `migrate` is idempotent and has `--dry-run`.
- `lean-pkg record NAME EVENT --field K=V`: evidence events with required
  fields and registry effects (`consent-recorded`, `palomar-preflight-pass`,
  `palomar-submitted`, `palomar-review`, `palomar-registered`,
  `palomar-withdrawn`, `doi-minted`, `reservoir-listed`, `mathlib-pr-opened`);
  `validate` refuses a DOI whose commit no Palomar entry names; `audit` finds
  `palomar-preflight-missing`.
- `comparator-receipt --mechanism auto|toolchain|legacy`: the toolchain
  mechanism runs `lake comparator` with the toolchain's bundled NanoDa and
  con-ron through the vendored PalomarTemplate `verify-comparator.sh`
  (Lean v4.35.0-rc2 or later, what Palomar runs); legacy keeps the pinned
  stack. Receipt schema `comparator-receipt/2` with `mechanism` and per-
  mechanism `tools`; schema 1 still validates.
- `gate` on an already-public package records the receipt and the
  `gate-passed` event without changing the status.
- `record NAME reservoir-listed` verifies the listing against Reservoir's
  package API (a 404 refuses; an unreachable network records `verified: false`).
- The toolchain mechanism checks that `bwrap` can create a user namespace
  before judging and names the Ubuntu 24.04 AppArmor fix when it cannot.
- Governance: `SECURITY.md`, issue and pull-request templates with a required
  AI-assistance line, `docs/decisions/` (0001 files and git only; 0002
  benevolent maintainer with deputies), deputy and succession lines in
  `MAINTAINERS.md`.
- Private-boundary check scans only files git would ship.
- Agent skill `search-before-building`: Loogle, Mathlib at the pin, the
  Reservoir index (not the name-only site search), Palomar, known authors and
  the GitHub long tail, with every query recorded and one decision per need;
  step 0 of `lean-paper-companion` and a row in the router.
- FAQ section on Reservoir: how it differs from lean-pkg and Palomar, why
  there is nothing to register (listing is automatic), and searching it
  before formalizing.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-05

First tagged release: the tool extracted from its private lab origin into its own
repository, with the comparator tier and the documentation site. The
repository is private at this version; checks were run locally (see
RELEASING.md).

### Added
- `lean-pkg` registry CLI: statuses `scratch → active → gate-pending →
  verified-private → public → upstreamed`, leases (`claim`/`release`),
  lower-tier receipts (`lake build`, sorry scan, `#print axioms`) bound to a
  commit, `gate`, `promote` with a dry-run checklist and a one-way `--yes`,
  `audit`, `llms` contract output.
- Comparator tier: `comparator-receipt` runner wrapping the vendored Palomar
  `comparator-check.sh`; all-or-nothing evidence write; host policy;
  `lean-pkg comparator --receipt [--check]`; `gate --comparator`;
  audit findings `comparator-drift` and `comparator-missing`.
- Evidence-only descendant rule: a receipt bound to commit X is accepted at
  HEAD H when H descends from X and only `.lean-receipts/` paths differ.
- Eighteen agent skills under `skills/` with an installer for Claude Code
  and Codex (`scripts/install_skills.py`).
- Documentation site (`docs/`, Jekyll Cayman): motivation, getting started,
  how-to, lifecycle, receipts, comparator, CLI, agents, newcomers, sample
  workflow with a seven-step diagram, FAQ, skills; client-side search and a
  dark/light toggle; `llms.txt`.
- Private-boundary check (`scripts/private-boundary-check.sh`) and a test
  suite of 240 tests.
- Secretary-bird logo and favicon; `CITATION.cff`.
